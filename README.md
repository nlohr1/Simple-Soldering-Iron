# Simple-Soldering-Iron
Simple Soldering-Iron - reverse-engeneered and modified to a half-phase-"dimmer", adding a diode for 230VAC.

Many Cheap Soldering-Irons came with simple Phase control steering, similar to dimmer-controls for lamps.  
Originally dimensioned for 115VAC, they are overheating at 230VAC, burning through in short time, because  
the Wattage becomes four times greater as intended.  
If you purchased one of these, its no need to give up - simply convert the circuit from full phase-control  
to a half phase-control, insering a small generic Diode between the RC-link and the Diac, so this Diode  
lets pass only one phase of the main-voltage. Therefore the generated power results normal (about 60W) and  
temperatures of the iron don't run-away.
